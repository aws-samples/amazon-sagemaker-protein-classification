    "**Proteins** are the key fundamental macromolecules governing in biological bodies. The study of protein localization is important to comprehend the function of protein and has great importance for drug design and other applications. It also plays an important role in characterizing the cellular function of hypothetical and newly discovered proteins [1]. There are several research endeavours that aim to localize whole proteomes by using high-throughput approaches [2–4]. These large datasets provide important information about protein function, and more generally global cellular processes. However, they currently do not achieve 100% coverage of proteomes, and the methodology used can in some cases cause mislocalization of subsets of proteins [5,6]. Therefore, complementary methods are necessary to address these problems. In this notebook, we will leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for protein sequence classification. The idea is to interpret protein sequences as sentences and their constituent – amino acids –\n",
    "as single words [7]. More specifically we will fine tune Pytorch ProtBert model from Hugging Face library."

    "## What is ProtBert?\n",
    "\n",
    "ProtBert is a pretrained model on protein sequences using a masked language modeling (MLM) objective. It is based on Bert model which is pretrained on a large corpus of protein sequences in a self-supervised fashion. This means it was pretrained on the raw protein sequences only, with no humans labelling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of publicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those protein sequences [8]. For more information about ProtBert, see [`ProtTrans: Towards Cracking the Language of Life’s Code Through Self-Supervised Deep Learning and High Performance Computing`](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.12.199554v2.full).\n",

With SageMaker, data scientists and developers can quickly and easily build and train machine learning models, and then directly deploy them into a production-ready hosted environment. \n",
    "During the training, we will leverage SageMaker distributed data parallel (SDP) feature which extends SageMaker’s training capabilities on deep learning models with near-linear scaling efficiency, achieving fast time-to-train with minimal code changes.\n",
